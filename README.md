# AndroidMemoryGame
Repository for a simple card matching app built in Android Studio.
The app is divided into two main activities:
1. Image Fetching
2. Card Matching

# Image Fetching
Here the user will have the ability to choose the images they would like to be used in the card matching activity.

1. Select an image hosting site url from the dropdown to fetch images.
2. The first 20 images scraped from the selected url will appear in a 5x4 grid.
3. Select any 6 images. The app will then proceed into the next activity.

# Card Matching
Here the user will be presented with a 4x3 grid of cards to be matched.
The game ends once all 6 card pairs have been matched correctly.
User will then have the option to either restart the game using the same 6 images or exit and return to the image fetching activity.
